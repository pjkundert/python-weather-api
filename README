=Building=

==From source ==

Download the latest pywapi library from: http://python-weather-api.googlecode.com/files/pywapi-0.2.tar.gz


Untar the source distribution and run: 
{{{
  $ python setup.py build
  $ python setup.py install
}}}

=Getting the code=

View the trunk at: 
http://python-weather-api.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

Check out the latest development version anonymously with: 
{{{
svn checkout http://python-weather-api.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ python-weather-api-read-only
}}}

== Yahoo! Weather ==
Use the following function, that fetches weather report from Yahoo

=== *pywapi.get_weather_from_yahoo(* _location_id_ *,* _ units = 'metric' _ *)* ===


*location_id*: A five digit US zip code or location ID. To find your location ID,
browse or search for your city from the Weather home page(http://weather.yahoo.com/)
The weather ID is in the URL for the forecast page for that city. You can also get the location ID by entering your zip code on the home page. For example, if you search for Los Angeles on the Weather home page, the forecast page for that city is http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/USCA0638.html. The location ID is USCA0638.

*units*: type of units. 'metric' for metric and '' for  non-metric
Note that choosing metric units changes all the weather units to metric, for example, wind speed will be reported as kilometers per hour and barometric pressure as millibars.
Default value is 'metric'.

Returns:
*weather_data*: a dictionary of weather data that exists in XML feed. See http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/#channel



== Google Weather ==

Use the following function, that fetches weather report from Google

=== *pywapi.get_weather_from_google(* _location_id_ *,* _ hl = '' _ *)* ===

*location_id*: a zip code (10001); city name, state (weather=woodland,PA); city name, country (weather=london,england); or possibly others.

*hl*: the language parameter (language code)

Returns:
*weather_data*: a dictionary of weather data that exists in XML feed. [ExampleOfGoogleWeatherXML Example of XML responce from Google]


== NOAA ==
Use the following function, that fetches weather report from NOAA: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (United States)

=== *pywapi.get_weather_from_noaa(* _station_id_ *)* ===

*station_id*: the ID of the weather station near the necessary location

To find your station ID, perform the following steps:
 # Open this URL: http://www.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/seek.php?state=az&Find=Find
 # Select the necessary state state. Click 'Find'.
 # Find the necessary station in the 'Observation Location' column.
 # The station ID is in the URL for the weather page for that station.

For example if the weather page is http://weather.noaa.gov/weather/current/KPEO.html -- the station ID is KPEO.

Other way to get the station ID: use this library: http://code.google.com/p/python-weather/ and _Weather.location2station_ function.

Returns:
*weather_data*: a dictionary of weather data that exists in XML feed.

== `GisMeteo` ==
Use the following function, that fetches weather report from Gismeteo (russian weather service)

=== *pywapi.get_weather_from_gismeteo(* _location_id_ *)* ===

*location_id*: A location ID of the necessary place. 

To find your location ID, browse or search for your city from the Gismeteo page: http://informer.gismeteo.ru/xml.html?index=27612%CC%EE%F1%EA%E2%E0&&lang=ru (the page is in Russian). The location ID is in the URL for the XML URL for that city.

For example, if you search for New York on the GisMeteo page, the XML URLfor that city will be http://informer.gismeteo.ru/xml/*72503_1*.xml. So the location ID is *72503_1*.

Returns:
*weather_data*: a dictionary of weather data(forecasts only, not current weather) that exists in XML feed. See http://informer.gismeteo.ru/xml.html?index=27612%CC%EE%F1%EA%E2%E0&&lang=ru (at the page bottom)

==Script==
{{{
